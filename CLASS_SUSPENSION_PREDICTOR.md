# Class Suspension Prediction System

## Overview

The **Class Suspension Predictor** is an AI-powered system that analyzes real-time weather data from OpenWeather API to predict the likelihood of class suspensions in Batangas Province.

## How It Works

### Prediction Algorithm

The system calculates a risk score (0-100) based on multiple weather factors:

#### 1. Rainfall Criteria (Primary Factor)
| Rainfall (mm/h) | Risk Points | Classification |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| > 20mm          | +40         | Heavy rainfall - High risk |
| > 10mm          | +25         | Moderate rainfall - Medium risk |
| > 5mm           | +10         | Light rainfall - Low risk |

#### 2. Wind Speed Criteria
| Wind Speed (km/h) | Risk Points | Classification |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| > 60 km/h         | +35         | Strong winds - High risk |
| > 40 km/h         | +20         | Gusty winds - Medium risk |
| > 30 km/h         | +10         | Moderate winds - Low risk |

#### 3. Weather Conditions
| Condition       | Risk Points | Classification |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Thunderstorm    | +25         | Severe weather |
| Storm           | +25         | Severe weather |

#### 4. Temperature Extremes
| Temperature | Risk Points | Classification |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| > 38¬∞C      | +15         | Extreme heat |

### Risk Level Classification

Based on the total risk score:

| Risk Score | Likelihood | Suspension Probability | Color Code |
|------------|------------|------------------------|------------|
| 70-100     | VERY HIGH  | 85%                   | Red        |
| 50-69      | HIGH       | 65%                   | Orange     |
| 30-49      | MODERATE   | 40%                   | Yellow     |
| 15-29      | LOW        | 15%                   | Blue       |
| 0-14       | VERY LOW   | 5%                    | Green      |
