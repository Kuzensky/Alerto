```javascript
// Real-time calculations from Firebase reports
const calculateMetrics = (reports) => {
  // City distribution from actual reports
  // Weekly trends from last 7 days
  // Performance metrics from verified reports
  // Active users from unique reporters
};
```

**Real-Time Metrics:**
- **City Distribution:** Calculated from actual report locations
- **Weekly Trends:** Last 7 days of community activity
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Response Time: Based on verified report timing
  - Accuracy Rate: Verified reports / Total reports
  - Coverage Area: Number of unique cities with reports
  - Active Users: Unique reporters

**Data Visualization:**
